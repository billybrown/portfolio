title: Elsewhere Artist Collaborative
descripton: Artists residency in a thriftshop
longform: <p><a href="http://www.goelsewhere.org/">Elsewhere</a> is a museum and artist collaborative taking place in a former thrift and surplus store. They invite artsts to come in and create art installations with all of the things in the space.</p><p><a href="http://www.jessievogel.com">Jessie</a> and I took part in a month long artist residency at elsewhere where we worked on a number of projects, the main one being a sculpture called Plush The Ride. We collected all of the stuffed animals in the building and created a sort of carnival ride machine for them.</p>
