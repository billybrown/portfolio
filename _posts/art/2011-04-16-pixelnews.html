descripton: Pixelated photographs of unrest in the middle east.
longform: <p>Following the unrest in Libya from halfway across the globe has made it difficult for me to comprehend what is happening. I look at pictures and read articles on my computer - the same place where I go to watch Glee, play Minecraft and to check my facebook page.</p><p>This was a personal project about the media I consume and how I consume it.
