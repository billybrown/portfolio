title: Digital Arts Service Corps Imagery
descripton: A series of retro collages to support media and technology
longform: <p>The <a href="http://digitalartscorps.org/">Digital Arts Service Corps</a> is a one year program for tech-savvy Americorps*VISTA members who are paired with low-power radio stations and media arts and technology centers to create and support specific technology or arts related programs. I took part in this program for 2 years ... once in New Orleans and the next in Boston.</p><p>The Digital Arts Service Corps needed a suite of images for their website and other promotional materials. They wanted a retro look, but also a diverse one, so I ended up digging through a bunch of public domain graphics and altering them in photoshop.</p>
