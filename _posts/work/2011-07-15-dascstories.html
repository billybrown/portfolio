title: Digital Arts Service Corps Alumni Website
descripton: A place for alumni to share stories.
longform: <p>The <a href="http://digitalartscorps.org/">Digital Arts Service Corps</a> is a one year program for tech-savvy Americorps*VISTA members who are paired with low-power radio stations and media arts and technology centers to create and support specific technology or arts related programs. I took part in this program for 2 years ... once in New Orleans and the next in Boston.</p><p>After the Digital Arts Service Corps lost its funding they decided to make a website to share stories, memories or thoughts. They asked me to design it.</p>
