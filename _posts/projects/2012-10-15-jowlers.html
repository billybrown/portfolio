title: Jowlers
descripton: I mailed some plush art.
longform: A jowler is a still image of the face one makes while vigorously shaking one's head. My brother caught the jowling disease at a wedding and suggested I make a website showcasing the best jowlers. I got with my friend <a href="http://www.patrickmoberg.com">Patrick</a> and we put together a site. We did a quick redesign in 2011 and the submissions are still comming in. Long live the jowl.
