title: Stuffed Robots
descripton: I use to make robots.
longform: A company that <a href="http://jessievogel.com">Jessie</a>, <a href="http://patrickmoberg.com">Patrick</a> and I started back in 2005 where we made and sold plush robots. We eventually started getting them manufactured, first in America and then in China. We don't sell them anymore but we might revisit it in the future.
